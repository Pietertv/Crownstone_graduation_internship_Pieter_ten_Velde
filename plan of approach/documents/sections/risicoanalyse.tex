    Covid-19 comes back and the Netherlands will go in lockdown again.& Everybody can't go outside anymore which means the necessary equipment for testing is unavailable. & 
    Try to do as much as possible remotely &
    3 &
    1 &
    A lot of this project can be done remotely. The only problem would be the testing. Even if there is a lockdown there is a big chance the office is still open.

    The PCB doesn't work, because of a hardware mistake&
    The hardware wont work which will cost time and money&
    It has to be tested again on a breadboard until it works and then the PCB will be changed accordingly. &
    2&

    There is a chance this will happen and it will depend on the mistake what the impact will be, however there is a high chance it will not be a big issue.

    I wont be able to work because of the illness &
    Getting more time for the project or someone else will take over, this means clear documentation so it can be taken over easily &

    This will probably not happen and documentation will be ready if this is the case anayway.

    The laptop on which progress is made malfunctions or erases all files&
    All the work could be lost that was done offline. &
    Make sure the necessary files are stored somewhere else as backup& 
    3&
    2&
    Its not that big a problem because the documentation will be done online. The important things that can be lost will be Altium files so a git for that will be created.

    There has been a component shortage because of China. This could mess up the project quite a lot.
