Crownstone want to offer a router that has different features:\\
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Direct Bluetooth Mesh support
    \item Long term energy storage
    \item Matter Border Router support
    \item Connections 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Ethernet (RJ45)
        \item smart meter(RJ11)
        \item Heat pumps/solar panels/charging stations(RS485, screw connector)\\
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
The router will be placed in a fuse box and is an addition to a smart home hub(not a replacement). Especially the RS485 connection is important, because the router will play an important role in the energy management. The router will also be modular.
