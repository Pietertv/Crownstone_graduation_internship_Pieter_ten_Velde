Crownstone, established in Rotterdam, Stationsplein 45 d1.118, https://crownstone.rocks, is a manufacturer of smart plugs and connections. Crownstone designs products like switches, dimmers, energy monitoring and soft fuses. Crownstone's technology aims to play an important role in the energy transition with a "smarter home". This can be done for example by playing in on the residents of the home(turning on lights or the heating when people are present), by getting a better insight into energy consumption or by using energy on smart moments. An excess of energy is often caused by sustainable energy sources like wind and solar energy. By limiting the excess of energy, a household will truly use the generated sustainable energy.
