Crownstone, established in Rotterdam, Stationsplein 45 d1.118, https://crownstone.rocks, is a manufacturer of smart plugs and connection. Crownstone designs products such as switches, dimmers, energy monitoring and soft fuses. Crownstone's technology targets to play an important role in the energy transition with a "smarter home". This can be done by for example playing in on the residents of the home(turning on lights or the heating when people are present) or by getting a better insight into energy consumption or by using energy on smart moments. An excess of energy is often caused by sustainable energy sources like wind and solar energy. By limiting the excess of energy a household will truly use the generated sustainable energy.
