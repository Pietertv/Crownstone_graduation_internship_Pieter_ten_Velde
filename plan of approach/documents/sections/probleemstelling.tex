The Crownstone hardware can be controlled from a smartphone. However the use of a smartphone means:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item no switching from a distance
    \item no continuous storage of the energy usage
    \item not for example, being able to react to changing electricity prices.
\end{enumerate}

By using a hub like a PI with an Crownstone dongle with Home Assistant from a Homey this becomes (partially) possible, but a lot of functionality stays absent.
