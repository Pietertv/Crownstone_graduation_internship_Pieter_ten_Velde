The quality of the project is very important and there will be steps taken to guaranty the success of the project. The most important will be shown in \autoref{tab:Quality}

    \begin{tabular}{l|p{8cm}}
        \bf Weekly progress report & Every week there will be a progress report, explaining what has been done and checking if the project is still on track \\\hline
        \bf Meeting with the client & This is done to ensure that the clients wishes are kept up.\\\hline
        \bf  Administration & The files will be uploaded to git at least every week so there is an backup, besides this the versions of the project document will be kept up. \\\hline
        \bf Discussing component choices & The component for the microcontroller needs to be decided by working with the person that will work on the firmware side. \\\hline
        \bf Simulations & Before making it the circuit will be simulated if possible. This is to ensure that no unnecessary components will be wasted or ordered. \\\hline
        \bf W-model & This model works by starting up like the V-model by doing everything one by one. So first the definition phase, then the architecture phase after that the design phase and lastly the implementation and testing. The W model will do the implementation phase in parts so more trial and error then all at once.\\
