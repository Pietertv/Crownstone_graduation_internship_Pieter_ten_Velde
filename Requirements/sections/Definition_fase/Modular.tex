The router will be modular by using wireless communication as to create a mesh network. In this chapter the requirements for the wireless and modular will be given.

\newRequirement{1.1}{CH}{
    The Router can have a range to communicate with other wireless devices of 20 meters
}

There also needs to be a connection to WiFi or Bluetooth. These requirements are all hardware based since the code will be written in another project.
\newRequirement{1.2}{MH}{
    The router needs to be able to connect to other devices with Bluetooth.
}

\newRequirement{1.3}{MH}{
    The router needs to be able to connect to other devices with WiFi.
}

\newRequirement{1.4}{MH}{
    The router must have options that extra modular connection can be added.
}

\newRequirement{1.5}{MH}{
    There needs to be a modular connection for Ethernet
}

\newRequirement{1.6}{SH}{
    There needs to be a modular connection for the rs485 protocol
}

\newRequirement{1.7}{SH}{
    There needs to be modular connection for smart meters
}

\newRequirement{1.8}{MH}{
    The modular connections needs to shut down if the wrong connection is inserted
}
