This will give the requirements for the transformer so the router can be plugged in and have the right amount of voltage and current for the controller.

\newRequirement{4.1}{MH}{
    The Router will need short circuit protection if it overloads or if someone connects the wrong input.
}

\newRequirement{4.2}{MH}{The input of the system will be 5 V}

\newRequirement{4.3}{MH}{Transform the input voltage to the correct voltage so the microcontroller can use it.}
